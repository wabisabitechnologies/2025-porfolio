I help founders and product teams align strategy, validate ideas, and ship with speed.

My approach blends research, systems thinking, and rapid prototyping so stakeholders can make confident decisions with artifacts they can see, test, and feel.

**I operate as a hybrid IC–Leader:** hands-on in design and engineering craft while driving product direction, clarity, and alignment across teams. I take ambiguous, high-stakes problems, frame them clearly, and push them toward outcomes with momentum and precision.
