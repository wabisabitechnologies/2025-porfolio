I help teams turn ambiguity into clarity. My work blends deep user research, systems thinking, and rapid prototyping to create products that solve real problems for real people.

**Hybrid IC–Leader:** I'm hands-on in design and engineering while driving product direction, ensuring alignment across teams, and delivering measurable outcomes. I specialize in regulated environments where details matter and the cost of getting it wrong is high.
