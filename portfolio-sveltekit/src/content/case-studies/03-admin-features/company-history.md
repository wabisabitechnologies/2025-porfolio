# Company History & Notifications: Transparency Through Change Tracking

## Business Context: Governance Timeline

Every significant company change should be traceable:
- When was this director appointed?
- When did beneficial owner change?
- When were these shares allotted?
- When was this article amended?
- Who approved each change?

**Traditional Problem:**
- History is scattered (some in minute book, some in emails, some in old documents)
- No timeline view (When exactly did everything change?)
- No notification to stakeholders (Company changes, but employees don't know)
- Audit review is painful (Compile all changes across multiple records)

## How SFL Solves It

### **The Workflow:**

**1. Auto-Timeline Generation**
- Every material change creates timeline entry:
  - Director appointed [Jan 15, 10:30 AM, approved by CEO]
  - Beneficial owner changed [Jan 20, verified Jan 21]
  - Share capital increased [Jan 25, approved by shareholders]
  - Articles amended [Feb 1, effective Feb 1]

**2. Stakeholder Notifications**
- Change happens: System identifies who should know
- Notification sent: Email + SMS + in-app alert
- Audit trail: "Director A was notified of appointment on Jan 15"

**3. Company History View**
- Timeline visualization: See all changes chronologically
- Filter options: "Show all director changes", "Show all BO changes", etc.
- Details: Click any entry to see full details + approval proof

**4. Regulatory Queries**
- "Show all changes in 2024" → Timeline export (ready for auditor)
- "When was this person a director?" → Exact dates + proof
- "What was beneficial ownership on Dec 31?" → System shows state at that date

## Value for Clients

**Transparency:**
- "What changed in our company this year?" → Clear timeline + stakeholder notifications
- Investor confidence: "We know exactly how our ownership/governance evolved"

**Audit Ready:**
- Auditor asks for governance history → System exports complete timeline
- No scrambling to find old documents

---

## Value for Practitioners

**Efficiency:**
- Audit preparation: Export timeline (vs. manually compiling changes)
- Stakeholder communication: Automatic (system notifies, you don't)

## Client Story

**Before SFL:**
- Auditor asks: "Show me all changes to beneficial ownership this year"
- Practitioner searches: Board minutes, emails, old registers
- Compilation takes 4-5 hours
- Some changes aren't clearly documented
- Auditor questions: "Why is there a gap in ownership records March-June?"

**With SFL:**
- Auditor asks: "Show me all BO changes this year"
- Practitioner: Clicks "Export timeline" → Downloads complete history
- Full documentation: Who changed ownership, who approved, when effective, verification status
- Complete accuracy: No gaps or discrepancies

**Outcome:**
- 90% reduction in audit prep time
- Perfect governance documentation
