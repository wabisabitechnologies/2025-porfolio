# System & Super Admin: Platform Governance & Oversight

## Overview

System administration involves:
- Platform health monitoring
- Compliance oversight (which practitioners are following standards?)
- Dispute resolution (if two practitioners have conflicting information)
- Regulatory coordination (if CBK/CMA queries)
- Security monitoring (unauthorized access attempts, data integrity)

**SFL Admin Role:**
- Monitors all companies on platform
- Ensures compliance standards are maintained
- Provides practitioner support + guidance
- Escalates regulatory/security issues

**2. Data Integrity**

- Enforce consistency across all records
- Audit suspicious changes (mass transfers, sudden permissions changes)

**3. Practitioner Management**
- Monitor practitioner behavior (following SFL standards)
- Resolve disputes (if practitioners disagree on data)
- Track practitioner performance (compliance rate, client satisfaction)

**4. Regulatory Interface**
- Respond to CBK/CMA queries
- Coordinate with authorities on compliance issues
- Track regulatory changes and implement them
