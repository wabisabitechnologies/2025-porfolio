# Genesis Admin Views: Practitioner Dashboard for Multiple Entities

## Business Context: Managing Multiple Companies at Scale

Practitioners (company secretaries, compliance officers) manage multiple companies simultaneously:
- 30-50 companies
- Each with directors, shareholders, beneficial owners
- Each with compliance deadlines (annual BO verification, register updates, etc.)
- Each with pending approvals, decisions, or actions

**Traditional Problem:**
- Email-based tracking ("Did Company A submit BO verification?")
- Spreadsheet dashboards (manually updated, always out of date)
- Missed deadlines (which company's annual filing was due this month?)
- No consolidated view (spend 30 minutes just finding status across all companies)

## How SFL Solves It: Unified Practitioner Dashboard

### **The Genesis Admin View:**

**1. Company Overview Dashboard**
- List all managed companies at a glance
- Each company shows: Name, type, status, last activity
- Visual indicators: Red/yellow/green for compliance status
- Quick actions: Click to manage specific company

**2. Compliance Tracking**
- What's due: All companies' upcoming compliance deadlines
- BO verification: Who hasn't verified? When re-verification due?
- Annual filing: Which company's annual review is overdue?
- Regulatory updates: New rules affecting which companies?

**3. Pending Actions**
- What needs attention: Approvals pending, decisions pending, invitations unaccepted
- Across all companies: See everything in one view
- Priority alerts: Deadline in 3 days, deadline in 1 day, deadline TODAY

**4. Team Management**
- Across companies: Who has access to what?
- Permission assignments: Manage user access across portfolio
- Team onboarding: Add new staff member to multiple companies at once

**5. Reporting**
- Portfolio summary: X companies, Y beneficial owners verified, Z pending decisions
- Compliance report: Which companies are on-track? Which are at-risk?
- Audit trail: Full history of changes across all companies

## Value for Practitioners

**Efficiency:**
- Unified view vs. jumping between 30 company portals (saves 1-2 hours per week)
- Compliance alerts eliminate missed deadlines
- Bulk actions (e.g., send BO verification invitations to all companies in October)

**Professional Standards:**
- Systematic management (not ad-hoc email tracking)
- Dashboard demonstrates: "I'm managing these companies professionally"
- Client confidence: "My service provider has oversight of all my governance"

**Scalability:**
- Manage 50+ companies with small team (vs. 5-10 companies maximum traditionally)
