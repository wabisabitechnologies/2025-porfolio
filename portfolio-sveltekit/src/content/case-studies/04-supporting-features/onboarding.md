# Onboarding: First-Time User Guidance

## Overview

New users need guidance on how to use SFL:
- What is my role?
- What can I do in the system?
- Where do I find important information?
- What's expected of me?

**Traditional Problem:**
- Users log in without context (overwhelmed, make mistakes)
- Users miss key features (don't realize they can request access)
- Support burden (constant "how do I...?" questions)

---

- **Secretary:** "You maintain all records, manage permissions, ensure compliance"
- **Accountant:** "You can access financial data, monitor shareholding changes"

**3. First-Use Workflows**
- Director's first action: Approve a transaction (guided step-by-step)
- Secretary's first action: Set up team permissions (guided setup)
- Shareholder's first action: View holdings (simple visualization)

**4. Ongoing Support**
