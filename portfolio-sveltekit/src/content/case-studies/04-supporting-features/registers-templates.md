# Registers Templates: Pre-Built Compliance Framework

## Overview

Statutory registers are complex:
- Register of Directors (columns: Name, Appointment Date, Address, etc.)
- Register of Members (columns: Name, Address, Shareholding, etc.)
- Register of Beneficial Owners (columns: Name, ID, Ownership %, Verification Status, etc.)
- Share Ledger (columns: Date, From, To, Quantity, Consideration, etc.)

**Traditional Problem:**
- Companies don't know what a register should include
- They create custom registers (often incomplete, not compliant)
- Auditors find missing columns or incorrect format
- Year later: Try to add missing information (too late, record incomplete)
