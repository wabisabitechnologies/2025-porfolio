# Signature & Incorporation: Digital Signing & Corporate Birth

## Overview

Two critical processes:
1. **Digital Signature:** Documents need to be signed (board resolutions, articles, share transfers, etc.)
2. **Incorporation:** Companies go from "planned" to "legally registered"

## Digital Signature Integration

**What Needs Signing:**
- Board resolutions
- Shareholder approvals
- Articles of association amendments
- Share transfer documents
- Beneficial owner verification confirmations

**SFL Solution:**
- Integration with digital signature provider (e.g., HelloSign/Dropbox Sign)
- Document routing: System creates document, routes to signatories
- Signature tracking: Who signed, when, proof of signing
- Audit trail: Timestamped signatures, immutable proof
- Regulatory ready: Legally valid signatures for authority filing

**Example:**
- Board resolution created in SFL
- System routes to 3 directors for signature
- Each director receives email with signing link
- All 3 directors sign within 2 days
- System archives signed document + timestamps
- Document is ready for filing or external sharing

## Incorporation Support

1. Company details submitted (name, directors, shareholders, articles)
2. BRS filing prepared (auto-generated by SFL)
3. Certificate of Incorporation received from registrar
4. Company enters operational phase (SFL setup begins)

**SFL Integration:**
- Pre-filing checklist: Ensure all data is correct before submitting
- BRS template: Auto-generates filing data (name, directors, shareholders, articles reference)
