# Company Invite/Verify: Bring Stakeholders into Governance

## Business Context: The Stakeholder Coordination Problem

Companies operate with multiple stakeholders (directors, shareholders, employees, advisors) who need to collaborate on decisions. But getting everyone connected and verified is traditionally chaotic:
- Email invitations that might not reach everyone
- Manual verification that goes to multiple emails
- No way to know who actually received the invitation
- Scattered responses (some confirmed via email, some via phone)
- New stakeholder added = multiple manual notifications

## The Practitioner's Challenge

A company appoints a new director. What should happen?

**Traditional Process:**
1. Company secretary emails new director: "You've been appointed"
2. Email might get lost → Need to follow up
3. Director needs access to company documents → Secretary emails links separately
4. Director needs password → Another email
5. No formal confirmation of "director has received invite and is ready"
6. Director still unclear: "What's my authority? What do I need to do?"

**SFL's Advantage:** Systematic invitation + onboarding + verification.

## How SFL Solves It

### **The Invite & Verify Workflow:**

**1. Invite Stakeholder**
- Secretary creates invitation: "Invite [Name] as [Director/Shareholder/Secretary]"
- System sends email + SMS with unique link
- System tracks: Invitation sent (timestamp), status (pending/accepted/verified)

**2. Stakeholder Accepts**
- Invitee clicks link → Lands on guided onboarding
- Confirms: Name, ID, contact info, role understanding
- System verifies identity (matches record)

**3. Documentation Submission**
- System requests: Any required documents (ID, corporate registration, etc.)
- Stakeholder uploads → System stores securely
- System validates: Documents are acceptable quality

**4. Permission Assignment**
- System auto-assigns: Permissions based on role + designation
- Stakeholder sees: "Here's what you can access and do"
- System explains: Your role, your responsibilities, key documents

**5. Confirmation Complete**
- Secretary reviews: Stakeholder has confirmed identity + accepted role
- System marks: Stakeholder as "verified"
- System notifies: Company (new director confirmed), other directors (new person on board), accountant (team changed)

**6. Automatic Documentation**
- System updates: Register of Directors (new appointment date, verified status)
- System creates: Minute book entry (director appointed [date], verified [date])
- System generates: Role assignment document (proof of who approved this appointment)

## Value for Clients

**Speed:**
- New stakeholder onboarded in 2-3 hours (vs. 1-2 days of scattered emails)
- Everyone is automatically notified (no forgotten stakeholders)
- System guides new person through their role (reduces confusion)

**Compliance:**
- Verification is systematic (not ad-hoc email confirmations)
- Audit trail is automatic (who was invited, when they confirmed, what was verified)
- Regulatory proof: "Here's when we appointed this director and verified their identity"

## Value for Practitioners

**Efficiency:**
- Stakeholder onboarding: Automated (system handles invitations, tracking, verification)
- Follow-up: Automatic reminders (system tracks who hasn't responded)
- Documentation: System auto-generates appointment records + audit trail

**Professional Standards:**
- Systematic process (not ad-hoc)
- Complete audit trail (who did what, when)
- Regulatory confidence: "Our stakeholder verification is systematic"

## Client Story

**Before SFL:**
- Company appoints 3 new board members
- Secretary sends 3 separate emails with different information
- Director A responds immediately
- Director B asks clarifying questions (2-day delay)
- Director C never responds to first email, secretary calls to confirm (frustrating)
- No formal record of "when did the directors confirm they accepted?"
- Minute book entry created days later, unclear who approved what

**With SFL:**
- Company appoints 3 new directors
- System sends 3 invitations simultaneously
- Directors A, B, C accept within 1-2 days (reminders auto-sent)
- System verifies identity + confirms acceptance
- System auto-updates register + minute book
- Full audit trail shows: Who invited, who accepted, when, what was verified
- Total time: 2-3 days with perfect documentation

**Outcome:**
- Faster stakeholder onboarding
- Zero missed confirmations
- Automatic audit trail
