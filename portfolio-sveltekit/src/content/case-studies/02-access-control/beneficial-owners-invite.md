# Beneficial Owners Invite/Verify: CBK Compliance Made Simple

## Business Context: Kenya's Beneficial Ownership Mandate

The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) requires regulated entities (financial services, insurance) to identify and verify beneficial owners—the individuals who ultimately own the company, not just nominal shareholders.

**Why This Matters:**
- **CBK Compliance:** Regulated entities face KES 100,000+ fines for incomplete BO records
- **Regulatory Audits:** CBK audits specifically verify BO documentation
- **AML/CFT Requirements:** Know Your Customer (KYC) rules require beneficial owner verification
- **Cross-border concerns:** Many Kenyan companies have international ownership structures (need to verify ultimate ownership)

**Traditional Problem:**
- Manual questionnaires sent to shareholders asking "Who's the ultimate owner?"
- No standardized verification process
- Responses scattered (some via email, some verbal)
- No audit trail of verification (unacceptable for regulatory audits)
- Re-verification annually is chaotic (Who's changed since last year?)

## The Practitioner's Challenge

A regulated financial services company needs to:
1. Identify who the beneficial owners are (Could be individuals, or other entities, or family trusts)
2. Verify their identity (Get ID, passport, or corporate registration)
3. Document the relationship (How does this person own shares? Direct? Through a trust?)
4. Track ownership percentage and voting power
5. Submit to CBK in required format
6. Update annually

**Manual Process:**
- Send BO questionnaire to all shareholders
- Wait for responses (often 1-2 weeks)
- Verify submitted documents (manually check ID validity, corporate registration, etc.)
- Reconcile responses with shareholding records (make sure percentages add up)
- Compile CBK report (1-2 days of manual work)
- Re-verify next year (hope nothing changed, but have no way to track changes)

**Time Cost:** 4-6 hours per company per year (plus risk of incomplete verification).

## How SFL Solves It: Systematic BO Verification

### **The Verification Workflow:**

**1. Auto-Identification**
- System analyzes shareholders: "Who are likely beneficial owners?"
- Rules: Individual shareholder = likely BO. Corporate shareholder = investigate further
- System flags: "This is a holding company—need to verify who actually owns the holding company"

**2. Verification Initiation**
- System sends invitation to identified beneficial owner:
  - "You've been identified as beneficial owner of [Company]. Please verify your status."
  - Email + SMS notification
  - System provides: Step-by-step guidance, document upload templates

**3. Owner Response**
- Owner logs into system:
  - Confirms: "Yes, I'm the beneficial owner" or "No, I'm not"
  - Provides: ID/passport, confirmation of ownership %, relationship to company
  - Uploads: Supporting documents (corporate registration if BO is a company, trust deed if BO holds through trust, etc.)

**4. Secretary Verification**
- Company secretary reviews submission:
  - Checks: ID valid? Ownership % consistent with shareholding? Documentation complete?
  - Approves or requests clarification
  - System timestamps all verification steps

**5. Compliance Documentation**
- System auto-generates: CBK beneficial ownership form (pre-filled with verified data)
- System provides: Audit trail showing who verified what, when, what documents were reviewed
- System tracks: Verification date, next due date (annual re-verification)

**6. Annual Re-Verification**
- System reminder: "BO verification due for annual compliance review"
- System initiates: Re-verification request to all previously verified owners
- System tracks: Changes (if BO changed, ownership %, etc.)
- System flags: Any changes trigger new audit trail entries

## Client Story

**Before SFL:**
- Company needs to verify beneficial owners for CBK audit
