# Share Capital Management: Define, Track, Update

## Business Context: Share Capital Complexity

Companies raise capital through shares. Managing share capital requires:
- **Definition:** What share classes exist? (Common, preference, founder?)
- **Authorization:** How many shares authorized by articles?
- **Allotment:** Which shareholders hold how many shares?
- **Classes:** Different classes have different voting/dividend rights
- **Restrictions:** Some shares locked for vesting, some non-transferable
- **Tracking:** When did each shareholder acquire shares? At what price?

**Traditional Problem:**
- Share structure scattered across multiple documents (articles, board minutes, cap table)
- Updates manual and error-prone (Add shares for ESOP → Update 3 different files)
- No audit trail (When did Employee A actually get shares? Who approved it?)
- Mismatch between legal structure and accounting records (Articles say X shares, cap table says Y)

## How SFL Solves It

### **Share Capital Workflow:**

**1. Define Share Classes**
- System captures: Authorized share capital (total amount)
- Each class: Voting rights, dividend rights, transfer restrictions
- Example: 100,000 authorized common shares, 50,000 preference shares

**2. Allot Shares**
- Record: Who gets shares? How many? At what price?
- System validates: Doesn't exceed authorized amount
- System creates: Share certificate + audit trail

**3. Share Ledger**
- Live tracking: Each shareholder's holdings by class
- Historical: When was this share allotted? Who approved it?
- Reconciliation: Ledger ↔ Articles ↔ Accounting records (consistency enforced)

**4. Cap Table**
- Visual representation: Who owns how much? (by %)
- Automatically updated: New allotments, transfers, vesting
- Export ready: For investor reports, tax filing, accounting

**5. Beneficial Ownership Integration**
- Connect: Share ownership → Beneficial owner verification
- Track: If ESOP shares vest, does beneficial ownership change?
- Compliance: CBK sees verified ownership structure

## Client Story

**Before SFL:**
- Company decides to issue ESOP shares to 20 employees
- Secretary manually updates: Articles cap table, board minutes, accounting system
- Board meeting approved 10,000 shares for ESOP, but article allows only 8,000 authorized → Discrepancy discovered 2 weeks later
- Tax audit asks: "Show me when each employee share was issued" → Scramble to find approvals
- Cap table shows different numbers than accounting records (frustrating)

**With SFL:**
- System validates: Authorized amount allows 10,000 shares (no overage risk)
- Secretary allots shares to 20 employees via system
- System auto-generates: Share certificates, cap table, minute book entry
- System enforces: Articles limits (can't exceed authorized amount)
- Tax audit: System exports complete share issuance history with timestamps + approvals
- Cap table: Always matches accounting records (consistency enforced)

**Outcome:**
- No overage risk (system validates)
- Perfect documentation
- Automatic cap table management
