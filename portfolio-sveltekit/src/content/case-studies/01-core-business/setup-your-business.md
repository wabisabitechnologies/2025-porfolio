# Setup Your Business: From Incorporation to Operational Governance

## Business Context: The Onboarding Overwhelm

Starting a company in Kenya requires navigating:
- **Legal Registration:** Company name availability, articles of association, memorandum
- **Regulatory Requirements:** CBK notification (if regulated), CMA registration (if public), industry regulator approval
- **Tax Setup:** KRA PIN, VAT registration, tax compliance obligations
- **Governance Structure:** Define roles (directors, secretaries, shareholders), establish decision-making authority
- **Statutory Records:** Prepare minute book templates, share registers, beneficial ownership declarations
- **Financial Setup:** Bank account, capitalization, share class definition
- **Stakeholder Coordination:** Multiple parties (lawyers, accountants, regulators, founders) working in parallel

**The Traditional Problem:**
- Founders don't know what documents they actually need
- Each advisor (lawyer, accountant, registrar) maintains separate records
- No single source of truth about company structure
- Post-registration: Company information scattered across multiple systems
- Regulatory filing feels like a separate project, not part of setup

**Time Cost:** 3-6 weeks for setup + 1-2 weeks to get company operational in a management system.

## The Practitioner's Challenge: The First-Company Founder

An entrepreneur is incorporating their first manufacturing business. They're overwhelmed:

**What They Don't Know:**
- What's the difference between private and public limited company? (Affects shareholder limits, governance, capital raising)
- How many directors do we need? (Legal minimum = 1, best practice depends on company type)
- What's beneficial ownership? (CBK requires declaration, but founders don't know they need it)
- What articles of association do we need? (Legal template? Or custom? What does it mean?)
- How do we document share allotments? (Multiple employees need shares as part of ESOP)
- What minute book entries do we need? (Board meetings? Just incorporation?)

**Practitioner's Job:** Educate + guide them through each step, ensuring nothing is missed.

**Current Reality:**
- Founder creates company via BRS (basic data entry)
- Founder calls lawyer: "We need articles" (2 days turnaround)
- Founder calls accountant: "We need share structure" (1 day)
- Founder calls company secretary: "How do we document this?" (scattered guidance)
- Result: Company is legally registered, but governance structure is informal/unclear
- Year later: Investor due diligence reveals "governance is undocumented"

## How SFL Solves It: Guided Setup Workflow

SFL inverts the setup process: **Structured guidance + template-driven + outcomes-focused.**

### **The Setup Workflow:**

**Phase 1: Company Classification**

System guides founder through key decisions:
- "What type of company are you?" → Private/Public/CLG/LLP/FC (affects all subsequent decisions)
- "How many founders/shareholders?" → Determines board size, voting structure
- "Is this regulated?" → Financial services/insurance/other (adds CBK requirements)
- "What share structure?" → Single class or multiple classes? (affects complexity)

**System provides guidance:**
- "Private company: Max 50 shareholders, can have 1 director, simpler articles"
- "Public company: Min 3 directors, public shareholders, more compliance requirements"
- "Regulated entity: CBK beneficial ownership declaration mandatory"

**Outcome:** Founder makes informed choices, system pre-configures appropriate setup.

**Phase 2: Governance Structure Definition**

System guides founders to define:
- **Board:** How many directors? Their roles? (CEO, CFO, independent director?)
- **Shareholders:** Initial allocation (Founder A gets 60%, Founder B gets 40%, etc.)
- **Beneficial Owners:** Who are the ultimate owners? (Often same as shareholders, but not always if there are nominees)
- **Company Secretary:** Who manages compliance? (Can be external)
- **Approvers:** Who can approve major decisions? (Board, shareholders, CEO, secretary?)

**System provides templates:**
- "Typical startup board: CEO + CFO + 1 independent" → Pre-populate with generic roles
- "ESOP structure: Founder + employees" → Define employee share vesting framework
- "Joint founders: 50/50 split with deadlock resolution clause" → Template with standard protections

**Outcome:** Governance structure is clear and documented from day one.

**Phase 3: Articles of Association Setup**

System guides article selection:
- **Model Articles:** Standard template for company type (80% of companies use model articles)
- **Customized Articles:** Special provisions needed? (e.g., investor protection clauses, employee share schemes)
- **Regulated Articles:** If CBK/regulated, articles must include specific clauses (automatic included)

**System explains key articles:**
- "Directors' appointment clause" → How are directors appointed/removed?
- "Shareholder voting rights" → Who votes on what? What % needed for approval?
- "Share transfer restrictions" → Can shareholders sell shares freely? Any pre-emption rights?
- "Beneficial ownership clause" → How is BO verified + disclosed?

**Outcome:** Appropriate articles selected, founder understands governance rules.

**Phase 4: Statutory Records Template**

System generates initial statutory records:
- **Minute Book:** First entry auto-generated (Company incorporation, initial shareholders/directors)
- **Register of Directors:** Initial directors added with appointment dates
- **Register of Members:** Initial shareholders added with holdings
- **Register of Beneficial Owners:** BO verified (simple case: shareholders = beneficial owners)
- **Share Ledger:** Initial allotments recorded

**System explains:**
- "These records must be maintained throughout company life"
- "Keep minute book for all important decisions"
- "Beneficial owners must be verified annually"
- "Regulatory filings reference these records"

**Outcome:** Company has audit-ready records from day one (not scrambling later).

**Phase 5: Stakeholder Setup & Permissions**

System helps founder establish team:
- **Add directors:** System sends invitations, sets up access with DIRECTOR role permissions
- **Add company secretary:** System sets up with REGISTRAR permissions (maintains records)
- **Add accountant:** System sets up with limited permissions (see financials, shareholding changes)
- **Add shareholders:** System sends invitations, sets up with appropriate permissions (based on shareholding %)

**Each team member:** Gets onboarded with clear role, documentation, and guidance.

**Outcome:** All stakeholders are in system, permissions are clear, governance is transparent.

**Phase 6: Regulatory Filing Preparation**

System generates regulatory-ready documentation:
- **BRS Filing:** Auto-populates company data, directors, shareholders, articles reference
- **CBK Declaration (if regulated):** Beneficial ownership form, verification status
- **Articles Document:** Ready for filing + reference by regulatory authorities
- **Incorporation Certificate:** Linked in system (uploaded or auto-retrieved)

**System explains what to file where:**
- "BRS requires annual update of shareholding" → Automatic reminder + pre-filled form
- "CBK requires BO verification" → System triggers verification workflow, sends notifications
- "CMA requires director disclosure" → If public company, auto-generates required form

**Outcome:** All regulatory requirements are documented and tracked.

## Technical Achievement: Smart Setup Scaffolding

**Key Innovation:** System understands company type + regulatory environment + founder choices, then auto-configures everything appropriately.

Example Decision Tree:
```
"Is this a regulated entity?"
├─ No → Use standard articles, basic CBK notification
└─ Yes → Add CBK articles, beneficial owner verification, regulatory contacts

"How many shareholders?"
├─ 1-2 → Simple governance structure
├─ 3-10 → Board formalized, quorum rules matter
└─ 11+ → Public company considerations, voting mechanics matter

"Is there an ESOP?"
├─ No → Simple share structure
└─ Yes → Add vesting rules, employee notification, special share class handling
```

Each path auto-configures articles, registers, permission templates, regulatory tracking.

## Why This Matters for Kenya's Startup Ecosystem

Many startups fail at compliance because:
- Founders don't know what governance means
- Documentation is scattered (governance is afterthought)
- Regulatory deadlines are missed (no tracking system)
- Scaling stalls because "governance isn't professional enough" for investors

**SFL's Role:**
- Makes professional governance **accessible and automatic**
- Demystifies articles, registers, beneficial ownership for first-time founders
- Enables founders to focus on business (compliance is handled)
- Positions Kenya's startups as professionally managed from inception
