# Articles of Association: Company Governance Rules

## Overview

Articles of Association define how a company operates. They specify:
- Board composition and powers
- Shareholder voting rights
- Decision-making thresholds (70% majority for this, 51% for that)
- Share transfer restrictions
- Dividend policies
- Dispute resolution

**Traditional Problem:**
- Articles are static documents (sit in a drawer)
- Decisions made by people who haven't read the articles
- When questions arise ("Can we do X?"), someone has to find the articles and interpret them
- Articles changes are complex (need shareholder approval, re-filing, etc.)

## How SFL Integrates Articles

### **The Governance Model:**

**1. Article Selection**
- SFL provides: Model articles for common company types (Private/Public/CLG)
- System explains: Key clauses and what they mean
- Customization: Modify specific articles for special requirements

**2. Rule Enforcement**
- System knows: "Shareholder approval requires 75% majority" (from articles)
- System knows: "Directors approval requires 2/3 majority" (from articles)
- System enforces: "This transaction requires shareholder vote per Article 12" (automatic detection)

**3. Decision Routing**
- When major decision needed: System checks articles → "This requires shareholder approval"
- System automatically routes to shareholders for vote
- Articles define who votes: All shareholders? Only common shareholders? Weighted voting?

**4. Amendment Process**
- Amending articles: Requires shareholder special resolution (usually 75%+)
- System orchestrates: Shareholder voting process, documents approval, files with registrar (if required)
- New articles version: System updates, all subsequent decisions follow new rules

## Value for Clients

**Clarity:**
- "Can we do this?" → System checks articles → "Yes, but needs X approval"
- No more "I think we can..." (system enforces actual rules)

**Compliance:**
- Articles compliance is automatic (system enforces)
- Amendments are documented + filed
- Regulatory proof: "Our decisions follow documented governance rules"

## Value for Practitioners

**Decision Support:**
- Client asks: "Can we appoint this director?" → System checks articles → "Yes, needs board approval"
- No need to manually consult articles (system handles it)

## Client Story

**Before SFL:**
- Company wants to do something (issue new share class, appoint external director, etc.)
- CEO guesses: "I think we can do this"
- Lawyer consulted: "Let me check the articles" (1 day)
- Articles found (in drawer, or someone's email)
- Lawyer interprets: "Yes, but you need shareholder approval with 75% majority"
- Process delayed 1 week because nobody knew articles required shareholder vote

**With SFL:**
- Company initiates decision in system
- System checks articles: "This requires shareholder approval with 75% majority"
- System automatically routes to shareholders for voting
- System enforces: Only 75%+ votes count as approval
- Decision complete once voting threshold met

**Outcome:**
- Articles are not just documents, they're operational rules
- Decisions follow governance + compliance automatically
