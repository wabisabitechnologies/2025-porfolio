			<p>
				I work at the intersection of product, UX, and engineering – especially on platforms where the
				interface needs to reflect complex rules or workflows. My focus is on reducing ambiguity, designing
				clear systems, and helping teams ship in real-world constraints.
			</p>
			<p>
				Over the past few years I’ve spent most of my time in regulated or operationally heavy spaces, where
				the details matter and the cost of getting them wrong is high. I enjoy working closely with engineers,
				ops, and domain experts to turn messy realities into tools people can rely on.
			</p>
			<p>
				This page will expand as I document more of that journey. For now, the
				<a href="/work/simple-formations" class="underline underline-offset-2 decoration-slate-400">
					Simple Formations case study
				</a>
				is the best place to see how I think and work in detail.
