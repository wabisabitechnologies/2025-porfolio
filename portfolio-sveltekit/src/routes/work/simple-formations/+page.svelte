				Over four years at Simple Formations, I went from UX developer to product lead on a platform that

				<p class="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
					I joined when Simple Formations was still a rough concept. A small group of us took scattered
					legal workflows and turned them into a working product. As the platform matured, my role shifted
					from hands-on execution to setting direction: shaping the information architecture, defining
					priorities, and connecting engineering, design, and compliance so we could ship real features
					under real constraints.

			<h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Problem and constraints</h2>
			<p class="max-w-3xl text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
				Starting and running a company in Kenya involves multiple agencies, shifting regulations, and
				paperwork that is often opaque to the people doing the work. Our users were industry professionals
				responsible for getting details right under time pressure, not casual consumers.
			</p>
			<p class="max-w-3xl text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
				We needed to design a platform that encoded complex legal workflows without hiding important details,
				kept companies compliant as rules changed, and respected how operations teams actually worked day to
				day. All under resource constraints typical of an early-stage product.
			</p>

			<p class="max-w-3xl text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
				Over time, Simple Formations grew into a set of connected modules rather than isolated flows:
			</p>
			<ul class="grid gap-4 text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-600 sm:grid-cols-2">
				<li class="space-y-1">
					<p class="font-medium text-slate-900">Company formation</p>

				<li class="space-y-1">
					<p class="font-medium text-slate-900">Director and shareholder management</p>
					<p>Update control and ownership with traceability for internal teams and regulators.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="space-y-1">
					<p class="font-medium text-slate-900">Filings and renewals</p>
					<p>Track and submit recurring obligations so companies stay compliant over time.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="space-y-1">
					<p class="font-medium text-slate-900">Compliance reminders and notifications</p>
					<p>Surface upcoming deadlines in a way that fits how professionals manage their clients.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="space-y-1">
					<p class="font-medium text-slate-900">Internal tools for operations</p>
					<p>Give ops teams workflows and status views that match their daily routines and edge cases.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="space-y-1">
					<p class="font-medium text-slate-900">Billing and account management</p>

				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="max-w-3xl text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
				Early on, a lot of work happened as ad-hoc flows. My job was to turn those into a coherent product:
				deciding what belongs where, how professionals move between tasks, and how to make room for new
				workflows without breaking what already worked.

				<div class="space-y-3 text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-600 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
					<p>
						<strong class="font-semibold text-slate-900">Problem:</strong> Manual permission management
						led to chaos – who can do what was unclear, and errors were frequent.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong class="font-semibold text-slate-900">Solution:</strong> Role-based access control with
						permission templates tied to company structure.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong class="font-semibold text-slate-900">Impact:</strong> 60% time savings + 95% fewer
						permission errors. Enabled practitioners to manage teams and delegate authority at scale.

					<p>
						<strong class="font-semibold text-slate-900">Why it matters:</strong> Shows architectural
						depth in designing scalable access patterns that align with business structure.

				<div class="space-y-3 text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-600 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
					<p>
						<strong class="font-semibold text-slate-900">Problem:</strong> Scattered statutory records

						<strong class="font-semibold text-slate-900">Solution:</strong> Business actions automatically
						generate register entries, ensuring records are always current and consistent.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong class="font-semibold text-slate-900">Impact:</strong> 70% time savings + 85% compliance
						risk reduction. Records are now audit-ready at all times.

					<p>
						<strong class="font-semibold text-slate-900">Problem:</strong> Multi-party approvals were

				Bridging teams and leading through clarity
			</h2>
			<p class="max-w-3xl text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
				As the platform grew, my main job became creating clarity across disciplines.

			<ul class="space-y-2 text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-600 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
				<li>
					<strong class="font-semibold text-slate-900">With engineering:</strong> Translated workflows into
					buildable units, negotiated scope when constraints were tight, and stayed close enough to the code
					to keep conversations grounded.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong class="font-semibold text-slate-900">With compliance and legal:</strong> Turned dense rules
					into flows and edge cases we could design and test for, instead of treating them as one-off tickets.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong class="font-semibold text-slate-900">With operations:</strong> Listened to how work
					actually happened, including all the messy exceptions, and fed that back into both design and
					implementation.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="max-w-3xl text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
				Not every feature worked the first time. We launched, watched where professionals or ops got stuck,
				and iterated. That rhythm of ship → observe → adjust is what moved the product from zero to something
				teams could rely on.

			<p class="max-w-3xl text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
				Over four years we went from an idea on paper to a platform that industry professionals use to start
				and run companies with more confidence and less friction.
			</p>
			<ul class="space-y-2 text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-600 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
				<li>Consolidated fragmented manual steps into a set of clear flows and tools.</li>
				<li>Gave professionals and ops a shared source of truth for company state and obligations.</li>
				<li>Built a product foundation that can grow as regulations and services evolve.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="max-w-3xl text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
				If I were to extend this work further, I would focus on surfacing more real-time insights back to
				professionals, deepening self-serve capabilities where regulation allows, and continuing to tighten
				the feedback loop between usage, ops, and product decisions.
